# Inode Management System

## Introduction
The Inode Management System provides an efficient way to manage filesystem inodes using data structures and algorithms. This system simulates inode operations in a filesystem, including creation, deletion, and permissions management, organized within a linked list for optimal manipulation and retrieval.

## Features
- **Dynamic Inode Creation**: Add new inodes with unique identifiers.
- **Inode Deletion**: Remove inodes from the system.
- **Permissions Management**: Update permissions associated with each inode.
- **Search Functionality**: Find inodes by ID, creation date, or permissions.
- **Data Segregation**: Automatically manage data blocks when inode size exceeds predefined limits.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run an Inode Management System project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
- C++ Compiler (GCC Recommended)
- Basic understanding of file management and linked lists

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kushalpatel0265/Inode-Management-System.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd InodeManagementSystem

## Usage
1. Compile the project using a C++ compiler:
   g++ -o InodeManagement main.cpp
2. Run the compiled program:
   ./InodeManagement
3. Follow the on-screen menu to perform inode operations such as adding, finding, displaying, updating permissions, or deleting inodes.

### Example
    Inode Operations Menu:
    1. Add Inode
    2. Find Inode
    3. Display Inodes
    4. Update Permissions
    5. Delete Inode
    6. Exit
    Enter your choice:
